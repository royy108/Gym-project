               Eating nuts as part of a healthy diet may be good for the heart. Nuts contain unsaturated fatty acids and other nutrients. 
               And they're a great snack food — inexpensive, easy to store and easy to pack when you're on the go.<br>
               One drawback to nuts is that some may be high in calories, so it's important to limit portions. But choosing nuts instead 
               of a less healthy snack may just help you stick to a heart-healthy diet.

            Quinoa has gained popularity as a health food in the United States and other Westernized countries, though people have been 
            cultivating it in South America since ancient times (1Trusted Source).In fact, hundreds of years ago, the Inca people considered
             this ancient grain a sacred food.<br>

              grain alternatives has soared.

               Broccoli originated from the eastern Mediterranean. Then, it became popular in Italy. Although it has been a native of Italy
