                    Casein protein is a protein found in milk that gives milk its white color. Cow's milk consists of around 80% casein protein. In addition to milk, 
                    casein protein is found in yogurt, cheese, and infant formulas, as well as in a variety of dietary supplements. Do not confuse casein protein with
